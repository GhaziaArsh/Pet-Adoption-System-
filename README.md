# Pet-Adoption-System-
The C++ code for a pet adoption system manages pet profiles, adoption requests, and user interactions. It uses classes for pets and adopters, handles pet registration, tracks adoption status, and updates records. With functions for adding pets, processing adoptions, and viewing available pets, it streamlines the adoption process.
